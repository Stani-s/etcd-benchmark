ETCD-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------
• High coherency coefficient (β) is expected for etcd due to Raft consensus
• Each write requires majority consensus, increasing coordination overhead
• Read performance may be less affected if reads can be served from followers
• Consider read-only replicas for read-heavy workloads
• Cluster sizes of 3-5 nodes typically provide best balance of performance and fault tolerance

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Network Optimization:
   • Minimize network latency between nodes
   • Use dedicated network for cluster communication
   • Consider cluster locality (same datacenter/availability zone)

2. Workload Optimization:
   • Batch small operations when possible
   • Use transactions for related operations
   • Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

3. Configuration Tuning:
   • Adjust heartbeat and election timeouts based on network latency
   • Tune compaction settings for your data patterns
   • Monitor and optimize disk I/O performance
